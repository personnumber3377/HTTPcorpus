# HTTPcorpus
HTTP fuzzing corpus. This assumes that your server is open at 127.0.0.1:8080 and that it has random content inside of your server with random filenames (see https://github.com/personnumber3377/samplefilegenerator and https://github.com/personnumber3377/HTTP-request-generator) In addition to the use of those two of my own tools, I also used https://github.com/AFLplusplus/Grammar-Mutator for the corpus, and also huge thanks to the creators of https://github.com/lpereira/lwan , because I copied their request corpus here. You can use this as you want.

#Instructions:

You should use corpus_minified to fuzz your HTTP server. Do not use corpus/ because then you will end up with redundant cases. corpus_minified has been generated by running afl-cmin and afl-tmin on all of the files in corpus/ against apache httpd.
